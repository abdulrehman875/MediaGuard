 code is to implement and demonstrate two types of adversarial attacks (FGSM and PGD) on image classification models and to save the generated adversarial examples for further analysis. It includes utility functions for creating adversarial images, saving them in a human-readable format, and validating their impact on pre-trained models like ResNet18 or VGG16.

Complete Workflow and Purpose
Adversarial Attack Implementation:

FGSM Attack (generate_adversarial_example):
Generates adversarial examples using the Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM).
Purpose: Quickly perturb the image using a single-step gradient-based method.
Use Case: Benchmarking simple attacks on models.
PGD Attack (pgd_attack):
Implements the Projected Gradient Descent (PGD) attack, which is a multi-step iterative version of FGSM.
Purpose: More sophisticated adversarial attack for generating stronger adversarial examples.
Use Case: Evaluating model robustness under stronger and more realistic attack scenarios.
Image Processing and Saving (save_image):

Converts a tensor image back to a denormalized, resized, and human-readable format before saving.
Purpose: Allows visualization of both original and adversarial images for comparison.
Execution in if __name__ == "__main__" Block:

Purpose:
Load a pre-trained model (ResNet18 or VGG16).
Preprocess an input image to match the model's input format.
Generate adversarial examples using both FGSM and PGD.
Save the generated adversarial images to disk.
Primary Goals of the Complete Code
Understanding Model Vulnerabilities:

Investigates how small, imperceptible changes in an image can cause a model to misclassify it.
Compares the effectiveness of two attack methods: FGSM (simple, single-step) and PGD (stronger, multi-step).
Research in Adversarial Machine Learning:

Provides a basis for testing the robustness of image classification models to adversarial attacks.
Helps researchers develop defenses, such as adversarial training, to improve model resilience.
Practical Applications:

Model Evaluation: Test the robustness of pre-trained models against adversarial perturbations.
Defense Mechanisms: Develop strategies to protect models against adversarial attacks.
Visualization: Save and analyze adversarial examples to understand how attacks impact model predictions.
Reusability for Further Work:

The modular design (functions for FGSM, PGD, and image saving) enables easy reuse for various adversarial experiments.
The saved adversarial images can be used for model retraining or defense testing.
Code Workflow
FGSM Attack (from previous code):

Perturb the image using FGSM.
Save the adversarial image generated by FGSM.
PGD Attack (current code):

Perturb the image using PGD, which iteratively applies gradient-based updates.
Save the adversarial image generated by PGD.
Save Adversarial Images:

Denormalizes and resizes adversarial images.
Saves them to disk in human-readable formats.
Model Interaction:

Uses pre-trained models (ResNet18 and VGG16) to evaluate adversarial images.
Outcome
Adversarial examples (FGSM and PGD) are generated and saved for further analysis.
The project showcases both simple and advanced adversarial attack techniques.
It provides insights into the vulnerabilities of deep learning models to adversarial noise.
