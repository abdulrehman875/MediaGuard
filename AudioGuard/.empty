1. Load and Process Audio
The code loads an audio file (original_audio.ogg) using librosa.
It extracts the raw audio signal (y) and its sampling rate (sr).
2. Add Inaudible Noise
Noise Reduction Techniques:
add_inaudible_noise: Adds high-frequency noise components that are not perceptible to human hearing.
add_phase_shifts: Modifies the phase of the audio to introduce inaudible shifts.
add_perceptual_noise: Adds noise to perceptually significant regions of the audio.
These transformations are applied sequentially to create a noisy version of the audio.
3. Save and Analyze Noisy Audio
The noisy audio is saved as a WAV file (noisy_voice_message.wav).
It is resampled to 16 kHz for use with the YAMNet model (pre-trained for audio event classification).
4. Extract Embeddings
The original and noisy audio signals are passed through YAMNet to extract feature embeddings.
The embeddings are compared using cosine similarity to quantify how similar the noisy audio is to the original.
5. Visualize Results
Two visualizations are created:
A line plot comparing embeddings of the original and noisy audio.
A heatmap showing cosine similarity between the embeddings.
6. Noise Reduction
A spectral noise gating technique (reduce_noise_spectral_gate) reduces the noise in the audio.
The noise-reduced audio is saved as denoised_spectral.wav.
7. Analyze Denoised Audio
The denoised audio is resampled to 16 kHz and passed through YAMNet to extract embeddings.
These embeddings are compared to the original embeddings using cosine similarity.
Similarity results are visualized in the same way as before.
8. Outputs
The cosine similarity scores quantify the impact of noise addition and reduction on the embeddings.
The visualizations help to understand how the noise and denoising processes affect the audio's features.
Summary
The code implements a complete pipeline for:

Adding inaudible noise to an audio signal.
Evaluating the similarity of the noisy audio to the original.
Reducing the noise using spectral gating.
Comparing and visualizing the embeddings of the original, noisy, and denoised audio.
